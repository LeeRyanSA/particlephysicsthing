		        	<b>Identify your learning objectives.</b> 
		        	Every exercise should identify 
							the learning goals at the top. This allows the user/student to know what they 
							will be getting out of the exercise and whether or not it will be useful to them.
							It has the additional benefit of forcing the author to consider how they will structure
							the exercise and what they want the user to come away with.
		        </li>

		        	<b>Provide REAL data.</b> 
		        	While it is often useful to use Monte Carlo to emphasize
							certain aspects of the data analysis with a more controlled dataset, I feel it is
							important to encourage experiments to provide their data to the public. If an
							experiment wants this site to host some of their data and activities, I would require
							at least some of the data actually come from their experiment.

				    However, it would be great to have some common repository for different experiments to 
				    have their data used to teach people science and train the next generation of particle
				    physicists. I am therefore happy to include data and activities (at any level!) from 
				    interested individuals. To this end, I have some helpful suggestions (and requirements!)
				    for those of you who would like to contribute.
